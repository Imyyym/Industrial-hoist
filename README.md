This project focuses on motor fault detection, utilizing a CNN network model and PID control. The execution method is as follows: In the MATLAB command line, type `openExample('deeplearning_shared/ClassifyMotorFaultsUsingDeepLearningExample')`. After execution, the necessary parameters are stored in the workspace. Then, you can run new1-6. Currently, the PID control model runs well, but CNN fault detection is not yet complete; this is the direction for future work.

Starting with new3, the motor module used is different. The Magnetic Rotor module is highly sensitive to high-frequency signals and is more difficult to control than the PMSM module. However, its advantage is that it has simulation models of faulty parts, allowing for subsequent motor fault diagnosis based on needs. If the focus is on developing the control model, this is not necessary, and the PMSM module can be used. (Note: The Magnetic Rotor module may exhibit issues such as flux harmonics, cogging torque, non-sinusoidal back EMF, and hysteresis/eddy current losses.)
